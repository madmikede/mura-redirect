mura-redirect
=============

Redirect plugin for mura cms to redirect to a given url

This is a really easy plugin for redirecting to another page.

## Usage
Pretty easy: Add the plugin to a page and enter the URL you want to be redirected, when the page is opened.
You can use a relative URL like **/pathTo/MyPage** to redirect to a page in your website, or use an absolute URL like **http://www.mydomain.com** to redirect to an external website.

## Attention!!
With this plugin it is really easy to generate endless loops! So be careful, when you add the	plugin and point to a page below the page and inherit the object to the pages below.
